\section{Exercises\protect\footnotemark }
\footnotetext{All files are provided in the appropriate task in PoliformaT. Links throughout the report use a \href{\github}{GitHub} repository with the exact same files.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Time the method encaja. (\gitline{encaja-e1.c}{\#L167})\\
        Measured using two calls to \texttt{double omp\_get\_wtime(void)}
    \item Parallelize each loop (if possible):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Loop \texttt{i} cannot be parallelized without great alterations to the code\footnotemark, as each iteration depends on the result of the previous one.
        \footnotetext{A possible parallel version could store all rows in an array, and each thread would pick a row as reference row to find its next row and then use the result as its new reference row, building shared linked lists (one per thread). When a thread has as result a row that is the head of another linked list, it would merge its linked list with the other, and would pick a new non-solved row as its new head. At the end, there would be a linked list containing the proper order of the rows, and a new loop would be needed to apply the result to the image matrix.}
    \item Loop \texttt{j} can be parallelized with the clause \texttt{private(x, distancia)}. The last \texttt{if} of the loop must be protected with a \texttt{critical} clause and the condition has to be rechecked after entering the critical section. (\gitline{encaja-e2-pJ.c}{\#L118})
    \item Loop \texttt{x} can also be parallelized, employing a \texttt{reduction(+:distancia)} clause to compute the distance correctly. (\gitline{encaja-e2-pX.c}{\#L120})
    \end{enumerate}
\item Improve the program by breaking out of loop \texttt{x} if the partial sum surpasses the current minimum. Solved adding an \texttt{if} that breaks the loop in that case. (\gitline{encaja-e3.c}{\#L122})
    \item Parallelize each loop using the code from Exercise 3 (if possible):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Loop \texttt{j} is parallelized in the same way as in Exercise 2. Source code: \gitline{encaja-e4-pJ.c}{\#L118}
        \item Loop \texttt{x} cannot be parallelized using a \texttt{for} clause, as some iterations may be cut short by the modification in Exercise 3.\\ Instead, it must be a \texttt{parallel} block where each iteration is assigned manually to each thread. Each thread gets the iterations that satisfy: $$x = \mod(\texttt{omp\_get\_num\_threads()}) + \texttt{omp\_get\_thread\_num()}$$ It still needs a \texttt{reduction(+:distancia)} clause. (\gitline{encaja-e4-pX.c}{\#L120})
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Theoretical analysis}
\label{sec:theoretical}
To properly understand the values obtained by measuring the different programs, a few concepts must be defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Overhead}: time spent by the system creating, activating and deactivating threads when entering and exiting parallel regions. This time increases with the number of threads, though the computing time might be reduced. This increase is significant if the computing time of a thread is smaller than its overhead.
	\item \textbf{Speed-up}: improvement in speed of execution of a task by the parallel algorithm in comparison to its sequential counterpart. It is a multiplier over the speed of the sequential algorithm: values greater than 1 are an improvement, while values lower than 1 are a diminishment.
	\item \textbf{Efficiency}: relation between the speedup and the number of threads available. This signifies the amount that each thread contributed to the speedup.
\end{itemize}

Knowing that loop \texttt{j} contains loop {x}, in Exercise 2, loop \texttt{j} is expected to have better results than loop \texttt{x}, because of their respective size (\texttt{x} has only one instruction) and number of times they are executed ($i$ vs $\frac{i^2}{2}$). Probably loop \texttt{x} will have overhead problems.

Exercise 3 provides a great improvement, as it cuts, on average, loop \texttt{x}'s iterations in half, and this change is propagated to Exercise 4, that will combine the improvements from both 2 and 3. In Exercise 4 the comparison between \texttt{x} and \texttt{j} will still be the same described in Exercise 2.

\section{Experimental analysis}
\subsection{Experiment environment and execution}
All the programs have been compiled and executed in the cluster provided by the university\footnote{\url{kahan.dsic.upv.es}}.

The job file \gitname{encaja.sh} compiles\footnote{See the associated \gitname{Makefile}}, executes and checks the result of all the exercises, printing the results in \texttt{csv} format. On top of that, it executes the parallel programs with 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 threads.

The following tables show the results of each experiment. Please note that the time values in the following tables refer to the time used by the method \texttt{encaja}, not the whole program, which also includes reading and writing the file.

\subsection{Time comparison}
In both \texttt{j} loops, the time tends to asymptotically approach 0 as the threads increase, whereas in both \texttt{x} loops, time tends to infinity.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:graph-time} and predicted in section \ref{sec:theoretical}, loop \texttt{j} performs much better than loop \texttt{x} in both versions. The overhead problem in loop \texttt{x} is so great that with number of threads greater than 8, its results begin to worsen dramatically (still, \texttt{x} is an increase respect to the sequential version).

Exercise 3 greatly improves over Exercise 1, and its parallel versions (Exercise 4 -over Exercise 2) return the best results for loop \texttt{j}. Loop \texttt{x} performs better than the initial sequential version, but much worse than Exercise 3.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:graph-time}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{The data in the graph for $threads=1$ represents the timing from the sequential versions of the program, and NOT the parallel versions with 1 thread.}


\subsection{Speed-up}
The speedup is computed as:
$$S(n,p)=\frac{t(n)}{t(n,p)}$$
Applying the previous formula with $t(n)=t_{encaja-e1}$ and $t(p,n)$ equal to each value in Figure \ref{fig:table-time} we obtain Figure \ref{fig:table-speedup}. In this case, all values are $>1$, therefore there is improvement in all cases respect with Exercise 1. The highest result is obtained by \texttt{encaja-e4-pJ} using 32 threads, being almost 60 times faster.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l r r r r r}
        Program               & 2t     & 4t     & 8t     & 16t    & 32t    \\ \hline
        \texttt{encaja-e2-pJ} &  2.196 &  4.294 &  7.734 & 12.871 & 20.985 \\
        \texttt{encaja-e4-pJ} & 10.584 & 19.168 & 30.724 & 46.052 & 59.306 \\
        \texttt{encaja-e2-pX} &  1.828 &  2.789 &  2.742 &  1.859 &  1.192 \\
        \texttt{encaja-e4-pX} &  3.749 &  3.613 &  2.951 &  1.760 &  1.121 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Speedup}
    \label{fig:table-speedup}
\end{figure}

An interesting speedup to compute would be that of Exercise 4 respect to Exercise 3, focusing the parallelization and not on the improvement of Exercise 3 over 1. This answers the question: How better can Exercise 3 be if parallelized? The answer lays on Figure \ref{fig:table-speedupR3}. The eye-catching situation is in loop \texttt{x}'s row, in which all values are $<0$, and therefore showing that parallelizing loop \texttt{x} provides no improvement respect to the sequential version. The apparent betterment shown in Figure \ref{fig:table-speedup} is respect to the initial program. The threads --- \unskip \, time graph in Figure \ref{fig:graph-time} clearly shows that the performance of \texttt{encaja-e4-pX.c} (yellow) is below all other versions.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l r r r r r}
        Program               & 2t    & 4t    & 8t    & 16t   & 32t    \\ \hline
        \texttt{encaja-e4-pJ} & 1.899 & 3.438 & 5.512 & 8.261 & 10.639 \\
        \texttt{encaja-e4-pX} & 0.672 & 0.648 & 0.529 & 0.316 &  0.201 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Speedup of \texttt{encaja-e4} respect to \texttt{encaja-e3}}
    \label{fig:table-speedupR3}
\end{figure}

In the graph in Figure \ref{fig:graph-speedup} one can appreciate the scale of the improvements of the different versions respect to Exercise 1, with the parallelization of loop \texttt{j} in Exercise 4 greatly exceeding all others 2 or 3 times over. The almost flat lines at the bottom of the graph that show the speedup of loop \texttt{x} demonstrate how insignificant the improvement is respect to loop \texttt{j}.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../img/speedup}
    \caption{Threads --- \unskip \, speedup graph}
    \label{fig:graph-speedup}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Efficiency}
The efficiency of a parallel program is computed as:
\begin{equation}
E(n,p)=\frac{S(n,p)}{p}
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the number of threads and $S(n,p)$ the speedup previously computed. Figure \ref{fig:table-efficiency} shows the efficiency values for exercises 2 and 4. As previously defined in section \ref{sec:theoretical}, higher values mean better results.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r}
		Program 			  & 2t    & 4t 	  & 8t 	  & 16t   & 32t   \\ \hline
		\texttt{encaja-e2-pJ} & 1.098 & 1.074 & 0.967 & 0.804 & 0.656 \\
		\texttt{encaja-e4-pJ} & 5.292 & 4.792 & 3.841 & 2.878 & 1.853 \\
		\texttt{encaja-e2-pX} & 0.914 & 0.697 & 0.343 & 0.116 & 0.037 \\
		\texttt{encaja-e4-pX} & 1.874 & 0.903 & 0.369 & 0.110 & 0.035 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Efficiency}
	\label{fig:table-efficiency}
\end{figure}

As with the speedup, the efficiency can also be computed respect to Exercise 3. This provides a measure of the improvement provided by the parallelization only, leaving aside the comparison between Exercises 1 and 3.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l r r r r r}
        Program               & 2t    & 4t    & 8t    & 16t   & 32t   \\ \hline
        \texttt{encaja-e4-pJ} & 0.949 & 0.860 & 0.689 & 0.516 & 0.332 \\
        \texttt{encaja-e4-pX} & 0.336 & 0.162 & 0.066 & 0.020 & 0.006 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Efficiency respect to Exercise 3}
    \label{fig:table-efficiencyR3}

\section{Conclusions}
This laboratory practice is an extensive walk-through of OpenMP, parallelization techniques and best practices.

This practice has provided experience on what loops can be parallelized, how thread overhead affects the performance of multithreaded applications, and how clever algorithm modifications can always overpower just throwing more metal to the problem, as is the case in the implementation of \gitline{encaja-e3.c}. It has also further reinforced our knowledge in which control structures must be used for private variables, critical sections and shared values using OpenMP.
