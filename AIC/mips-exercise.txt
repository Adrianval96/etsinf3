We have a MIPS processor with a 2GHz clock. It is running a program P such that

Instruction     %   CPI
load            25  1.2
store           15  1
add             40  1.4
mult            10  1.4
branch          10  1.2

New instructions are introduced:
load-add
add-mult
Both with CPI = 2
Slow down the clock a 5%

Frequency of new instructions:
load-add will replace 25% of load instructions and the following add instructions
add-mult will replace 12.5% of add instructions and the following mult instructions


a) Compute the time that program P (with n instructions) needs to be executed

Tp = CPI * Tclock * n = 1.27 cycle/instruction * 5e-10 sec/cycle * n instruction = 6.35e-10 seconds
CPI is the weighted average of the values in the table above.


b) Compute the amount of instructions that P would contain if recompiled with the new instructions

25% of load is 6.25% of the total instructions
12.5% of add is 5% of the total instructions
                                    NEW PERCENT     CPI
add loses 6.25% + 5% = 11.25%   --> 28.75%          1.4
mult loses 5%                   -->  5   %          1.4
load loses 6.25%                --> 18.75%          1.2
load-add                        -->  6.25%          2
add-mult                        -->  5   %          2
store                           --> 15   %          1
branch                          --> 10   %          1.2
TOTAL                               88.75%

The new program will have 0.89*n instructions


c) Compute the new distribution of instructions
            PERCENT     CPI
add         32.39%      1.4
mult         5.63%      1.4
load        21.13%      1.2
load-add     7.04%      2
add-mult     5.63%      2
store       16.90%      1
branch      11.27%      1.2
TOTAL      100   %


d) Compute the new CPI

CPI = 1.34348

e) Justify whether this change is worth it (decreased instruction number, decreased speed, increased CPI)

Tp = newCPI * 1 / (freq * 0.95) * (n * 0.89) = 1.34348 / (2e9 * 0.95) * 0.89n = 6.29e-10 seconds

As the time for program P is lower for the modified processor, the modification is worthy (for this specific case)
